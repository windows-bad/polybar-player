A polybar module to display and interact with the most recent running player.

Includes logic to change the icon based on the player, title, or website
(firefox only).

# Requirements

This may vary between distributions, but on Arch Linux, you will need
`playerctl`, `lz4json` (from AUR), and `jq`.
